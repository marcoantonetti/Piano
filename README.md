# Piano
In this proyect I created a Piano which plays a note's frequency when its keyboard key is pressed. So if you press C the C note is played. I did this with due to a solid knowledge of JavaScript.  Modular and functional programming, scoping, debugging and naming conventions were crutial for this proggram to work.  Lastly I read the documentation of  Audiocontext which allowed me to play the notes.
